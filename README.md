# MSIA423-Project

 1. Project Charter
	 - Vision: The ever-changing mobile landscape is a challenging space to navigate. . While the number of mobile apps has been increasing over the past few years, the competition has became more and more intense. Therefore, it is crucial for software developers to improve their competitive advantage and understand the existing strategy to drive growth. This project will allow the users to predict the their apps' potential ratings and popularity based on its current features and therefore help developers to improve their apps.
	 - Mission: Enable users to input the features of their IOS apps and predict number of reviews and rating that specific app will receive and thus its popularity based on its features. 
	 - Success Criteria: 
		 - Model performance: R square. The final model is expected to have a R squared 20% higher than the initial simple linear regression model.
		 - Business sense: Ask the user to rate the app (thumbs up or thumbs down) and calculate the ratio. 
 2. Project Backlog
	 - Develop Themes: Help target users (software developers) to predict number of of reviews and ratings of their apps and therefore gauge potential popularity of their apps. Users can improve and make adjustment to their current version based on the results and potentially increase revenue. 
	 - Epics
		 - Exploratory Data Analysis to explore the relationship between variables and determine which subset to use.
		 - Data Engineering 
		 - Model Building
