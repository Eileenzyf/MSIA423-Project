# MSIA423-Project

 ## Project Charter
 

 - **Vision:** The ever-changing mobile landscape is a challenging space to navigate. . While the number of mobile apps has been increasing
   over the past few years, the competition has became more and more
   intense. Therefore, it is crucial for software developers to improve
   their competitive advantage and understand the existing strategy to
   drive growth. This project will allow the users to predict the their
   apps' potential ratings and popularity based on its current features
   and therefore help developers to improve their apps.
 - **Mission:** Enable users to input the features of their IOS apps and predict number of reviews and rating that specific app will receive
   and thus its popularity based on its features.
 - **Success Criteria:** 
   		 - Model performance: R square. The final model is expected to have a R squared 20% higher than the initial simple linear regression
   model.
   		 - Business sense: Ask the user to rate the app (thumbs up or thumbs down) and calculate the ratio.

 
 ##Project Backlog
 
 - **Develop Themes:** Help target users (software developers) to predict number of of reviews and ratings of their apps and therefore
   gauge potential popularity of their apps. Users can improve and make
   adjustment to their current version based on the results and
   potentially increase revenue.

 - **Epics**
	 -  Exploratory Data Analysis to explore the relationship between variables and determine which subset to use.
			 - Stories:
			1. *Merge two data sets (1 point)*
			2. *Data cleaning, check NA values and duplicates. (1 point)*
			3. *Distribution of each variables, check multicollinearity and outliners (1 point)*  
		 - Data Engineering 
			 - Stories:
			 1. *Variable transformation (1 point)*
			 2. *Split the data set to training and test set (1 point)*
		 - Model Building to predict the number of reviews and ratings using a set of parameters. 
			 - Stories:
			 1. *Run a simple linear regression model to check the R square, variable importance and residual plot to determine what advanced model to use. (2 point)*
			 2. 
		 - Web App Development to build interactive features that allow users to enter their data to get predictions.
